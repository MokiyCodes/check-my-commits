Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna give you up
Gotta make you understand
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
We know the game and we're gonna play it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
You're too shy to say it
Your heart's been aching, but
We've known each other for so long
Never gonna give, never gonna give
Never gonna give, never gonna give
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna give you up
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
We know the game and we're gonna play it
Inside, we both know what's been going on
You're too shy to say it
Your heart's been aching, but
We've known each other for so long
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna give you up
Gotta make you understand
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You know the rules and so do I
We're no strangers to love
